# pug-examples project
Made with examples from [this tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-beginners-guide-to-pug/#:~:text=Pug%20is%20a%20template%20engine,from%20a%20database%20or%20API.).
<br/><br/>
### To kick it off
Type the following command in your terminal:\
**pug -w . -o ./html -P**
<br/><br/>

#### *Note*
In the above command:

- the ***-w*** option stands for watch
- the ***.***(dot) tells Pug to watch everything in the current directory
- the ***-o ./html*** tells Pug to output its HTML in the html directory
- the ***-P*** option prettifies the output.
